## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings!
***NOTE***: This are warnings from the [textile](https://textile.io/) team, that we also want to share.

1. This is an experimental service, running on an experimental stack, connected to the Filecoin Testnet.
2. Things may go wrong, things may change without much notice, and your data may go away! Before mainnet, all of this is meant to explore, have fun, and learn.
3. We cannot offer support for lost data. In fact, you should expect all data to be reset at some points between now and the end of HackFS.
4. Again, don't put production things on this service.
5. Don't put important things on this service.
6. Don't put private or potentially insecure things on this service.
7. Don't put things you shouldn't on this service (harmful, mean, illegal, private, not yours).
